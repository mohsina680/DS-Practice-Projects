# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Movie Recommendation System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is a compact AI-based project built with Python using the **Netflix dataset** (`netflix_titles.csv`).  
It recommends **similar movies/shows** when you enter a title, based on description similarity.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works
- The dataset is processed using **TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency)**.
- Movie/show descriptions are compared using **cosine similarity**.
- The system suggests the **top 5 most similar titles** to the user input.
